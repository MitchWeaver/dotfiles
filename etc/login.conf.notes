# add your user to the "staff" group:
#
# $ usermod -G staff mitch
#
# this group has fewer restrictions on processes
# (however it doesn't grant any less secure priviledges...)
#
# edit /etc/login.conf and change "datasize-cur=XXXXM"
# to a higher value, (ex: 75% of your total ram on your machine.)
